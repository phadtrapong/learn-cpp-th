# E4/D8 — Module 3 content + micro‑project (grade classifier)

- Epic: E4 Content M0–M3
- Day: D8
- Status: TODO
- Owner: Unassigned
- Priority: P1
- Estimate: 1d

## Goal

Ship Module 3 (Decisions) with a small micro‑project (grade classifier) that consolidates comparisons and `if/else` usage.

## Description

Create Module 3 lessons on conditionals and comparisons. Define tasks and a micro‑project (e.g., map numeric score to grade) with deterministic tests. Ensure hints and translations are complete.

## Deliverables

- [ ] Module 3 content + tasks/tests
- [ ] Micro‑project (grade classifier) with test suite
- [ ] TH/EN hints/translations

## Acceptance Criteria

- A correct reference solution passes all tests
- Tutor provides targeted hints for common off‑by‑one and comparison mistakes

## Dependencies

- E4/D7 patterns for progress and hints

## Tracking Checklist

- [ ] Design finalized
- [ ] Implemented
- [ ] Reviewed/QA
- [ ] Docs updated

## Notes

Micro‑project should remain tiny; keep compile/run time minimal.
